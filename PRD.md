ii) and then everyone writes their word in the blank. 
iii) Scoring happens And And if any person has the same word as other people, then they get one point for every other person that has that same word. and if the person that asked the question is, has the same word, then they get an extra point. And if they asked a question that no one has a green words on or or everyone has a green word zone, then it's counted as a dud question. and the person asking the question gets a minus one point. 
iv) the whole game we iterate through the players in the same order and the game can only end when we've iterated through all the players X times - They get to pick the value of X.
